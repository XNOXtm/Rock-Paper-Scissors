This is a Stone Paper Scissor game which runs entirly through console.

Will add front end interaction as I learn more things. Had a lot of fun during this challege. It was preety simple though the repetition of rounds five times was a bit tough. Still I made it somehow via googling about while loops and fixing the variable calls somehow(that was irritating af).

Learn a lot about function, variables, conditionals, and somewhat of loop.
